# The +UnitMeasurements+ module serves as a container for various functionalities
# related to unit measurements. It provides methods for creating custom unit
# groups, defining units, performing arithmetic operations,  comparison between
# measurements, conversions, normalization of input strings, parsing measurements
# from strings, and more. It is a fundamental part of the unit measurements library.

    # Creates a new unit group based on the provided +block+ of instructions.
    #
    # The +build+ method allows you to define and create a custom unit group with
    # units and their conversions. It takes a block of instructions as an argument,
    # which is evaluated by an instance of +UnitGroupBuilder+.
    #
    # Within the +block+, you can use various methods provided by +UnitGroupBuilder+
    # to define units, group them into unit system, and set primitive unit of
    # the unit group. These methods include +primitive+, +system+, +si_unit+,
    # and +unit+.
    #
    # The resulting unit group is encapsulated in a new subclass of +Measurement+.
    # This subclass will have access to the defined units and their conversions
    # through the +unit_group+ class attribute.
    #
    # This method provides a powerful way to create specialized unit groups tailored
    # to specific measurement domains.
    #
    # @example
    #   UnitMeasurements.build do
    #     primitive "m"
    #
    #     system :metric do
    #       si_unit "m", aliases: ["meter", "metre", "meters", "metres"]
    #     end
    #
    #     system :imperial do
    #       unit "in", value: "25.4 mm", aliases: ['"', "inch", "inches"]
    #     end
    #
    #     cache "length.json"
    #   end
    #
    # @yield [builder]
    #   A block that defines the units to be added to the unit group.
    #   The block takes a {UnitGroupBuilder} instance as a parameter.
    #
    # @yieldparam builder [UnitGroupBuilder]
    #   The {UnitGroupBuilder} instance to define units within the unit group.
    #
    # @yieldreturn [UnitGroup]
    #   Returns an instance of {UnitGroup} containing the units and their conversions
    #   defined within the block.
    #
    # @return [Class]
    #   A new subclass of +Measurement+ with the defined units and conversions.
