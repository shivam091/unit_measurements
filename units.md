# Bundled unit groups and units

As there are lots of units bundled with `unit_measurements`, we recommend you to check below list of
bundled units before converting your measurements.

**Notes:**
1. Base unit for each unit group is highlighted.
2. Unit names suffixed with `*` support all [SI prefixes](README.md#si-units-support).
